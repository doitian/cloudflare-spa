# Development Guidelines

- Create single HTML apps with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS all in one file.
- Prefer Vanilla JavaScript and HTML instead of heavy frameworks such as React.
- Load 3rd party libraries via CDN only when the library can significantly simplify the app.
- Use Cloudflare Worker for server-side APIs only when necessary.
